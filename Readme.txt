The main theme of our project is to track the employee location during his/her feild work, and to automate the process of payrolls.
The three classifications are, Admin who is the highest authority has control over all employees and HR's , second is HR who can edit employees information, and the last are employees.

Online Database we used : login to https://phpmyadmin.co/ use the following credentials.

                                    Host: sql11.freesqldatabase.com

                                    User: sql11449131
                                    Pass: 5VrzvwfXZe

The Home page of the website has LOGIN button, which onclick navigates to a page where a EMPLOYEE or a HR can login.
    When a Employee login login time will be recorded and his picture will be captured , which stores in database .
 The current location of the employee will be recorded with latitude and logitude in particular, and gets updated for every 10 seconds without 
any information to the employee till he logout.

 When the employee logout the activity will be recorded and the time he is active is incremented.
 The Payroll is automatically incremented accordingly
    When HR login his login activity will be recorded.
    
    He can view employees count or can search for a particular employee using search bar.
    When the HR clicks on particular employee, he can watch his current location on GOOGLE MAPS , latitude and longitude
    He can check the salary of a particular employee.

    When the HR logout the activity will be recorded and the time he is active is incremented.
    The Payroll is automatically incremented accordingly

The login page for Admin is put seperately
